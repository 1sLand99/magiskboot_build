> ARM and macOS 14 CI builds are not yet added at the moment
>
> For Apple Silicon (M series) and Windows ARM users, you can compile magiskboot from source, or i686/x86_64 binaries should run with emulation.
>
> Similarly, ARM Linux users can install from source or use box86/box64 and QEMU to run i386/x86_64 binaries.
>
> For macOS user, binaries for the previous OS releases might work too.

### Tags

#### Build types

- `debug`: for getting logs only, don't use unless you know what are you doing

- `release`: if you are a normal user, download package with this tag

#### Linking method

- `aio`: all dependencies are included in the zip package

- `standalone`: single binary unlike `aio`, works without extra dependency

- `static`: similar to `standalone`, but C runtime library is also bundled within the binary, should theoretically work on all version of the specified OS, for example you can usually use `ubuntu-...-glibc-...-static` on all different Linux distributions, even if the distribution is using a different libc (e.g. Alpine Linux)

#### For Windows release only

- `msvcrt`: usually works on most Windows versions without extra setup

- `ucrt`: available by default only since Windows 10+, sometimes requires installing or shipping with C runtime library manually to use on older version

#### Miscellaneous

- `src`: source package, download this if you plan to compile magiskboot from source on your end
